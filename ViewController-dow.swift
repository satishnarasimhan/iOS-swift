///Gregorian calendar is calculated as:

///h = (q + [13(m+1)/5] + K + K/4 + J/4 + 5*J ) mod 7

///where
///h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)
///q is the day of the month
///m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, 5 = May, ..., 14 = February. January, the first month would count as the 13th month of the previous year)
///K is year mod 100
///J is the zero based century. This is determined by floor division i.e. year // 100 and determines the century -19 in 1995, 20 in 2017
